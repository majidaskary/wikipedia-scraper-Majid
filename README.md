# wikipedia-scraper-Majid
Wikipedia Scraper

#temporary README:

n this project, we will guide you step by step through the process of:

Creating a self-contained development environment (virtual environment)
Retrieving some information from an API
Leveraging your knowledge to scrape a website that does not provide an API
Saving the output for later processing
More specifically, in this project we will query an API to obtain a list of countries and their past political leaders. We then extract and sanitize their short bio from Wikipedia. Finally, we save the data to disk.

Scraping data is often the first coding step of a data science project (meaning, the data collection) and you will likely come back to it in the future.
